The x-TRAP (**X**-ray **T**herapy **R**obotic **A**nimal **P**ositioner) is designed to fufill the need of small animal positioning in radiation research. The philosophy of x-TRAP was to design a high precision, low cost, modular system that can integrate with other tools already available to small animal radiation researchers. 
The x-TRAP system consists of two major components, the Small Animal Positioning System (SAPS) and the Software Control Package (SCP). This page provides information on the 
SCP.

## Documentation
